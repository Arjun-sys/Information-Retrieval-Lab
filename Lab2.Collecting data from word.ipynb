      "Scope:\n",
      " Online Nagarpalika, where Certificate Distribution is a vital task of any Municipality so as its name define or verify this has a wide scope or cover wide aspect in current time. Some of the scope related to this field are listed below:\n",
      "i.Time Management: we can access services quickly without any delay until and unless some network issues.\n",
      "ii. Cost-effective: No need to travel to a physical location to get the work done. We can get our work completed in small time without traveling. Instead, the same service can be accessed at a much lower cost than usual.\n",
      "iii. Transparency: With the digitization of every piece of work and process, there is no place left for corruption or any biases. There is equality and a good relationship with every citizen.\n",
      "iv. Flexibility: It is much easier to inform a bunch of citizens of new projects, problems as well as services. Similarly adding another layer of services to an existing system is quite easy and time-effective compared to that huge paperwork in Manual offices.\n",
      "Limitations:\n",
      "i.Since the Nepalese government has invested lots of funds in the field of Information Technology, it has become another source for selfish government bodies to use that money for their personal use.\n",
      "ii. Citizens cannot access services at the moment if there is a problem in the system even if there is no issue in a network connection.\n",
      "iii. Online Nagarpalika is related to Municipality Performance which is a service-oriented system but used mostly to exhaust citizens to some extent with abundant notices and upcoming events.\n",
      "iv. In the current scenario, lots of citizens are found accessing online services and most of them are unknown about what they are accessing and also don’t know how to make the best use of them. So, it seems somehow they were confused about these online services.\n",
      "CHAPTER TWO: REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS AND FEASIBILITY STUDY\n",
      "2.1 Literature Review\n",
      "Local government and service delivery refer to the provision of public activities, benefits, or satisfaction. Service relates to the provision of both tangible public goods and intangible services (Johannison2007; Venter 2010). In rural areas and small towns, the provision of basic retail, social, health, education, and infrastructure services are a crucial foundation for day-to-day activities and maintaining the quality of life of local citizens as well as the local economic base (Halseth analyze 2006; Pollanen 2005). The South African Constitution requires that municipalities prioritize the basic needs of local communities and ensure that they have access to at least a minimal level of municipal services (Mafunisa2008). Municipalities should also promote the development of local communities (Venter 2010). To improve the delivery of public services, especially on the part of local government, the government of the day has to address the challenges that hamper service delivery in a more coordinated and proactive manner, focusing on macro-goals to develop the country’s infrastructure and ensure that all citizens benefit (Ching and Chan2004, Venter2010).\n",

The cost for the service is $24.00 to research the certificate in the North Carolina state registry and includes one copy of the certificate. Additional certificates from the same search will be $15.00 each. For residents born in Mecklenburg County, the cost for a certificate remains $10.00.\n",

      "2.2 Requirement analysis.\n",
      "Requirement analysis is the phase where the system is built based on its functional and non-functional requirements which describes how the overall system works and what functional characters it delivers. The system describes the overall workings and enlists the requirements of the overall project. In addition, a use case diagram also shows the overall procedure of the system. This overall working of the system and derive the requirements, detailed and thorough understanding of the system to be developed or being developed is needed. This understanding is developed by continuous coordination with the project team members. \n",
      "2.2.1 Functional Requirements\n",
      "The functional requirement should show how the system should react to the inputs and what set of desired output is obtained from the input. These requirements are according to the user i.e. how the system should operate and what output must be generated with the given set of inputs. For instance, the login must be allowed to authorized users only and should only permit the user with a genuine and verified username and password. Or in another case, the admin should only have the authority to add, assign or remove any particular users.\n",
      "2.2.1.1 Use Case Diagram\n",
      "A use case diagram at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved. Use case diagram identifies different types of users and their roles and also help to identify, clarify and organize system requirements.\n",

      "2.2.2. Non-Functional Requirements\n",
      "There are certain requirements in the system that describe how the system performs a certain function. It describes how the system should behave and what limits are there in its functionalities. These requirements when defined and executed well will help to make the system easy to use and enhance the performance. Some non-functional requirements that are implemented in “Online Nagarpalikat” are as follows:\n",
      "2.2.2.1. Interface  \n",
      "The Interface is designed by using a Markup language(HTML) and styling via a Scripting language (JavaScript) and CSS. These interfaces are embedded and the layout is designed using Microsoft ASP .Net Core. The Interface is simple and user-friendly and also easy to use.\n",
      "2.2.2.2. Performance\n",
      "The purpose of system development must be justified. The system should be able to provide accurate and reliable information to the user. \n",
      "2.2.2.3. Usability\n",
      "The system represents an online certificate management system and must provide accurate and genuine results to the users.\n",
      "2.2.2.4. Adaptability\n",
      "The system should be responsive and adaptive to various browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and also to handheld devices like mobiles, tablets, etc. The system also must be compatible with various operating systems like macOS, Windows, Linux.\n",

      "The feasibility study determines if the system can be built successfully with available cost, time, and effort. The study is conducted by analyzing the collected requirements. \n",
      "2.3.1 Technical Feasibility:\n",
      " All the tools and software products required to construct this project are easily available on the web. It does not require a special environment to execute. It needs an IDE. All these aspects are easily affordable. The application requires simple user interfaces but the implementation of functions is complex. \n",

After completing this, the certificate is generated on the admin side which is eventually made available to the client on demand. Then the user can give their feedback on the performance of the system as well as participate in efficiency measurement polls. Finally, the respective birth or death certificate is made downloadable to the user accordingly.  \n",

The Overviews defines the outline of the system and the possible working mechanism of the system. Users can also view detailed and updated information of Mandan Deupur Municipality with aspect-wise notices and events description and their importance on the development of the whole locality and also benefit from the contacts of vital individual and service organizations. There is also an additional feature for the complaint registering page, Notices, and information of the related development projects. Users also can view the custom form of the particular registration and certification. Limited access is provided to the users as all the other access is limited to the admin.\n",

The development of the overall system was possible via the development of the system in different parts and testing the system by combining individual parts and functionalities undergoing testing individual functions(Controllers) compatibility with others. Adding new functionality to the system and testing them, the overall system was developed.\n",

      "The unit test was done by feeding the system with several test cases. We performed a unit test by giving two invalid inputs as input and observed our output. The system presented with validation summary message.\n",
      "4.3.2 System Testing \n",
      "The system included two parts: One for the web application and the other for database connection. We tested our system for both. First, we verify the database connection with the Microsoft SQL Server. In the next phase, we developed a simple web application interface and integrated them to form a complete system. \n",
      "Finally, the whole application was tested when all the components were ready and integrated. Various unprecedented bugs were encountered during the system testing which was tackled for good system development. \n",

      "CHAPTER FIVE CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION \n",
      "5.1 Conclusion \n",
      "The major intention of this project is to develop a system where a citizen of Mandan Deupur Municipality can register for birth and death certificates through an online platform in the form of Online Nagarpalika However, the system would also distribute respective documents of certification through registration number. Doing so, the system would decrease the time required for the general public to get general information, form format, as well as death and birth certificate in the case of urgency and for better convenience. In addition, there is no biasedness in service delivery. \n",
      "Since the start of the project, we researched several services a general municipality is considered to offer and eventually we develop a system with the main objective of providing birth and death certificates with other vital functionalities. We planned to go with the simple MVC approach that included some basics of Ajax and Jquery. As per our plan, we developed a system that could operate as we have expected.\n",
      "However, we did not cover the most of functionalities as much as we have wanted. Our system can successfully provide birth and death certificates to intended citizens with help of the database. Another major issue is that our system takes quite a bit of time to process the input and give the resulted document. This has downgraded the appearance of the project since time is one major factor. \n",
      "5.2 Recommendation\n",
      "This application can always be improved no matter how hard we have tried to make it as we have expected. In our application, we have only allowed a user to register for the birth and death registration without any further additional functionalities and proper security. To improve further, we can add an authentication system for the user. \n",
      "In addition to this, we have only focused on the general notices and queries being asked but not the answer. The system focuses more on the admin panel. When there is more space for the general public citizen to deliver their contribution to municipality development and reward features along, the system would then be more people-friendly.\n",
      "Furthermore, we can add some more controller and model classes with views to generate more services in the admin panel for general citizens. This makes the system more flexible, modular, and manageable in the long run. \n",
      "5.3 Future Works\n",
      "The Municipality established by this project can be extended to several other locations of our country as well as globally. In our case, we have focused on a platform where users can access most of government official information and certification management performance. However, it can be further implemented on other tasks where the citizen’s opinion analysis and demonstration. Some of them can be listed as:\n",
      "Development Progress Ratio: To detect how subjected projects are being carried with online details being made available to every citizen. Instead of just a surface-level analysis, we can improve on upcoming projects to increase work proficiency. \n",
      "\n",
      " Community Discussion Forum: Group opinion and their concern toward any official upcoming projects are vital. So availability of a community discussion forum helps to gather recommendations and suggestions for local bodies to add services, notices and essential information.\n",
